#### Address

EPFL Campus, Lausanne, Switzerland; Building **ARTLAB, Room [A0 100](https://plan.epfl.ch/?room==ART%20A0%20100).**

#### How to arrive on campus

We highly recommend to use **public transportation** (Metro M1, stop EPFL) to come to the event as it is by far the best way to get around in Lausanne.          

SBB [mobile app](https://www.sbb.ch/en/timetable/mobile-apps/sbb-mobile.html) and [website](https://www.sbb.ch/en/home.html) are very handy for finding the fastest way, and your destination will be ‘Ecublens VD, EPFL’ or just ‘EPFL’. SBB gives timeschedules for both trains and local metros.

- Arriving from Lausanne by train: take the train to Renens (10 min) and then take the Metro M1 which starts in the train station next to Track 1. It will take you to the EPFL stop (5 min).
- Arriving from Lausanne by metro from the lake:  take the Metro M2 (direction Epalinges, Croisette), stop at  Lausanne-Flon, change to the Metro M1 that will take you to the EPFL (total 25min).        
- Arriving from Lausanne by metro from the city center:  take Metro M1 that will take you to the EPFL stop (17min).

If you are by car, you will need to find a space in the ‘White places’ (aka. visitor parking spots). More details on parking can be found on this [page](https://www.epfl.ch/campus/mobility/vehicles/car-parks/white-places/), including a link to a map indicating the available lots.

Here is the walking path from EPFL metro strop to ArtLab:

#### How to arrive to Lausanne

If you arrives by plane, the easiest way from Geneva Airport is by train. The train station is located in the airport itself, and there are multi-lingual ticket machines and a ticket counter available.
