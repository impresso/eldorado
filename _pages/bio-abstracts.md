**Christoph Hanzig, Martin Munke and Michael Thoß. Digitizing and presenting a Nazi newspaper – the example "Der Freiheitskampf".**

*Abtract*: The Saxon daily newspaper [“Der Freiheitskampf”](http://www.hait.tu-dresden.de/ext/forschung/der-freiheitskampf.asp) has been digitized and presented online in order to fill the significant lack of sources about the Saxon NSDAP. The editors are systematically indexing the content of its articles as well as compiling and categorizing the Saxon-related articles in a relational database. The talk will address several aspects of using digitized newspapers as a historical source, namely how to  a) offer a more critical approach to digital print sources by means of content-based indexing, than OCR; b) contextualize a newspaper collection by using standardized data; and c) engage with legal and moral questions relating to the digital presentation of an ideologically highly tainted source collection.Tackling these issues from the perspective of a research institution and of a provider of a research infrastructure allows discussing different points of views on the mass-digitalization of historical newspapers.

**Monika Kovarova-Simecek. Cultural History of Financial News in Vienna (1771-1914) – A historical analysis using ANNO/ÖNB digital repository and ÖNBLabs.**

*Abtract*: The talk illustrates how ANNO together with digital tools of ONBLabs can be used to explore the cultural history of financial news in Vienna from the foundation of the Vienna Stock Exchange in 1771 until its temporary closure in 1914. A keyword-based approach was used to extract and statistically analyse a data set of 4 million hits from 174 historical newspapers. The discovered patterns provide information about i.a. which newspapers and audiences were relevant in the evolvement of financial journalism in Austria, to what extent financial press emerged, and which social discourses were held on the occasion of this development. 


**Suzanna Krivulskaya. The Crimes of Preachers: Religion, Scandal, and the Trouble with Digitized Archives.**

*Abtract*: Late-nineteenth century U.S. newspapers provide a rich archive of the scandalous. Their rapid digitization has allowed historians access to an unprecedented volume of data. Yet nineteenth-century North American newspaper editors were not always reliable narrators of the past: they reprinted others’ stories, embellished key details, and sensationalized their narratives to sell copy. Focusing specifically on sex scandals involving Protestant pastors, this paper interrogates the possibilities and limitations of working with digitized newspapers in the age of big data.

**Petri Paju and Heli Rantala and Hannu Salmi. Cycles of Text Reuse in Finnish Newspapers and Periodicals, 1771–1920: Ontological and epistemological perspectives.**

*Abtract*: The paper explores the ontological and epistemological ramifications of text reuse. It draws on a research project on Finnish digitized newspapers and magazines, five million pages in total, from 1771 to 1920. The paper analyzes the different cycles of text reuse. Some repetition chains were very slow, lasting over 140 years, some were very rapid, viral chains of reuse. Our argument is that text reuse has ontological ramifications on how we conceive the past processes in a media network. At the same time, it involves epistemological considerations, especially on the material conditions of both newspaper publishing and its digitization process.

**Fredrik Norén with Pelle Snickars, Alexandra Borg, Johan Jarlbrink, Erik Edoff and Måns Magnusson. Measuring "the political" in Swedish newspaper data during the 1960s and 1970s.**

*Abtract*: The aim of our paper is to present, examine and explore the development of the concept of “the political” in Swedish newspaper data – gleaned from four major newspapers – during the post-war era. The traditional assumption is that “the political” increased and diversified dramatically during the 1960s and 1970s with new notions as “the personal is political”,  “political consciousness” and even “political fantasy”. We will empirically examine this assumption by first extracting and studying bigrams for the “political” from the newspaper data, and then deepen the analysis with explorative tools for topic modeling and network analysis. 


**Phillip Stroebel. Towards Large-Scale OCR for Historical Newspapers with Self-Trained Models.**

**Giorgia Tolfo & Living with Machine team. Hunting for Treasure: Living with Machines and the British Library Newspaper Collection.**

*Abtract*: We discuss the open access digitisation programme undertaken by *Living with Machines*, exploring the range of constraints that inform digitisation strategies and selection priorities. Because the landscape of digitised newspaper collections is so complex, and research and digitisation processes operate on different timelines, we have focused on opportunities to make digitisation choices both transparent and pragmatic. Working towards solutions that reflect collaborations between library curators and scholars, we will introduce: a) our custom visualisation tool—the Press Picker—designed to support decision making about digitisation; b) the process of automatic metadata generation from the Newspaper Press Directories, a contemporaneous record of British newspapers. 

 
**Andrew Torget. Mapping Texts: Examining the Effects of OCR Noise on Historical Newspaper Collections.**

*Abtract*: This paper documents the “Mapping Texts Project,” an experiment focused on the problem of OCR noise in historical newspapers. The purpose of the project was to combine text-mining with data-visualization to measure both OCR noise rates and their effects on how scholars detect meaningful language patterns embedded in large-scale digital newspaper collections.  The project developed two interactive visualizations measuring OCR quality and its effects on detecting language patterns, revealing the depth of the challenges facing humanities scholars seeking greater transparency of OCR data in historical newspaper databases.

**Melvin Wevers. Historical Advertisements in Digitized Newspapers as a Lens on the Past.**

*Abtract*: Historians have turned their focus to newspaper articles as a proxy of public discourse, while advertisements remain an understudied source of digitized information. This paper focuses on two aspects of working with extensive collections of advertisements. First, advertisements come in all shapes and sizes, ranging from classifieds, shipping reports to full-page ads. The size and position of these advertisements and particular word usage can help to construct particular subsets of advertisements.  Second, this paper describes how we can use extract textual information from historical advertisements that can be used for historical analysis of trends and particularities.
