<div style="text-align: justify"> From manual, on-site exploration of microfilm or paper collections to online keyword search over millions of OCRized page, <b>access to digitized newspapers has changed significantly</b>. Coupled with automatic enrichement of sources via text and image processing, this represents a whole world of new possibilities. <b>An Eldorado?</b> Despite undeniable merits, the digital transformation and the new affordance of historical newspapers  also brings some <b>drawbacks and possible pitfalls which need to be carefully assessed</b>. The Eldorado workshop, supported by the impresso project, will bring  together a group of historians, librarians, computer scientists and designers to discuss <b>how digitisation is changing historical research practices</b>.</div><br>
